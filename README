INSTALLATION:

Parts of GLDisplay use LIMA code, so LIMA should be built before GLDisplay.
This is already handled if GLDisplay is compiled as an option of LIMA 
(COMPILE_GLDISPLAY=1 in config.inc). In particular SPS (SPEC shared memory)
must included in the build configuration options (COMPILE_SPS_IMAGE=1)

- To manually build library and test programs:

  make

- To manually build Python wrapping using SIP:

  make sip

After that you should have:

  + build/:
       libgldisplay.so (C++ library)
  + sip/
       gldisplay.so (SIP module)
  + test/
       *_test  (C++ test programs)
  + python/
       __init__.py   (GLDisplay module initialisation code)
